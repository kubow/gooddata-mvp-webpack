npm warn deprecated @types/schema-utils@2.4.0: This is a stub types definition. schema-utils provides its own type definitions, so you do not need this installed.

npm warn deprecated babel-plugin-react-intl@8.2.25: this package has been renamed to babel-plugin-formatjs

npm warn deprecated intl-messageformat-parser@6.1.2: We've written a new parser that's 6x faster and is backwards compatible. Please use @formatjs/icu-messageformat-parser

npm warn deprecated core-js@2.6.12: core-js@<3.23.3 is no longer maintained and not recommended for usage due to the number of issues. Because of the V8 engine whims, feature detection in old core-js versions could cause a slowdown up to 100x even if nothing is polyfilled. Some versions have web compatibility issues. Please, upgrade your dependencies to the actual version of core-js.
